# Control-of-Mechanical-Systems
Control of Mechanical Systems Course (ES710) Project

## üìã Description
This project consists of modeling a pendulum-car nonlinear mechanical system and designing a controller for the nonlinear system and for the linearized system. Performance is analyzed in both cases. Then, using the designed controller, an equivalent digital controller is implemented for the methods: Zero Order Holder, Tustin and Pole and Zero Mapping. Finally, the performance of this digital controller is analyzed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software used

This project was implemented in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
